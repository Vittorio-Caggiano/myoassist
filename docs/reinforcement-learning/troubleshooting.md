    raise RuntimeError(
RuntimeError: `launch_passive` requires that the Python script be run under `mjpython` on macOS
```

**Solution:**  
If you see this error on macOS, simply use `mjpython` instead of `python` to run your script.  
You do not need to install anything extraâ€”just change the command:

```bash
mjpython example.py
```
